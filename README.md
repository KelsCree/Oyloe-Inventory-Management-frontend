## About
I have worked in the oilfield as a drilling fluids engineer for 9+ years. Every location I have worked has been remote and the climate is often 
extreme (North Dakota in the winter). Inventory management is one of the more unpleasant tasks to do in sub zero weather. I would have to go around location 
and count all products on location daily with a pen and paper. I would then have to bring that inventory count back to a computer to input it into a daily report. 
This was tedious, repetitive, and error prone. The Oyloe Inventory Management system allows workers to input daily inventory counts directly through an app on their
smart phone or tablet. This eliminates potential errors from transferring counts from a tally book to a computer for report purposes. Now the reports can be 
generated directly on the device. OIMS also allows incoming product deliveries to be added through the app so that all inventory management processes are controlled in one  
convenient location.
